        <p>Spice and Wolf is a Japanese light novel series written by Isuna Hasekura, with illustrations by JÅ« Ayakura. ASCII Media Works has published 24 novels since February 2006 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint. ASCII Media Works reported that as of October 2008, over 2.2 million copies of the first nine novels have been sold in Japan.</p>
            <br><p>The series has been called a "unique fantasy" by Mainichi Shimbun due to the plot focusing on economics, trade, and peddling rather than the typical staples of fantasy such as swords and magic.</p>
                <br><p>Yen Press licensed the light novels and is releasing them in English in North America. ASCII Media Works has published five volumes of a spin-off light novel series titled Wolf and Parchment since September 2016.
